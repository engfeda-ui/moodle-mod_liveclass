## 🌟 Key Features

   - Powered by LiveKit WebRTC SFU with automatic Simulcast & Dynacast bandwidth management.
   - Zero client installation: runs directly within any modern browser inside Moodle.
   - Screen sharing, live chat, multi-stream presenter mode, and digital whiteboard.

2. **⏱️ Automated High-Precision Attendance Engine**:
   - Discrete connection interval tracking (`liveclass_intervals`) to handle intermittent WiFi reconnects.
   - Automated time-on-task calculation against planned or actual session durations.
   - Configurable compliance threshold (e.g. 80% attendance required to receive `Present` status).
   - Instant synchronization with Moodle Activity Completion and Course Gradebook.

3. **🛡️ Active Proof of Presence (Inspired by LiveProctoring)**:
   - **Tab-Switching Counter**: Live telemetry detecting when students navigate away from lecture slides.
   - **Spontaneous Presence Polls**: In-class pop-up interaction prompts verifying active learner attention.
   - Instructor Live Attendance Dashboard with color-coded engagement badges.

4. **🚀 Zero Microsoft Account Friction**:
   - No Azure AD licenses, no external tenants, no guest invitations, and no lobby waiting.
   - 100% internal Moodle Single Sign-On (SSO) with cryptographic HMAC-SHA256 JWT tokens.
